class Solution:
    def maxWidthOfVerticalArea(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        """
        Calculates the maximum width of a vertical area formed by points on the x-axis.

        Args:
        - points (List[List[int]]): A list of points represented as lists [x, y], where x and y are integers.

        Returns:
        - int: The maximum width of a vertical area formed by these points on the x-axis.

        Algorithm:
        1. Sort the x-coordinates of all points in ascending order.
        2. Calculate the pairwise differences between adjacent x-coordinates.
        3. Return the maximum difference found.

        Example:
        maxWidthOfVerticalArea([[1, 8], [7, 3], [3, 6], [4, 1]]) returns 4
        - Explanation: The sorted x-coordinates are [1, 3, 4, 7].
                    The maximum width is 4 (difference between 4 and 7).
