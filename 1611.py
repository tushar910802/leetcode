class Solution:
    def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
        """
        Calculate the minimum number of one-bit operations required to convert an integer 'n'
        into zero using bitwise operations, where each operation involves flipping a single bit.

        Parameters:
        - n (int): The input integer.

        Returns:
        - int: The minimum number of one-bit operations required.

        Approach:
        - The function uses recursive bitwise operations to find the minimum number of steps.
        - If the input 'n' is 0, the function returns 0 as no operations are needed.
        - Otherwise, it calculates 'x', a power of 2 closest to 'n', and recursively calls
          the function with a modified value of 'n'.
        - The result is the sum of recursive calls, additional operations, and adjustments.

        Note:
        - The function uses bitwise XOR (^), OR (|), right shift (>>), and bit_length() operations.
