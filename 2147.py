class Solution:
    def numberOfWays(self, corridor: str) -> int:
        """
        Calculates the number of ways to place students in seats along a corridor,
        following certain conditions.

        Parameters:
        - corridor (str): A string representing the corridor where 'S' represents a student seat
        and any other character represents an empty space.

        Returns:
        - int: The number of ways to place students satisfying the conditions. The result
        is calculated modulo 1,000,000,007.

        Conditions:
        - Students must be seated in groups of two.
        - There must be at least two students.
        - The distance between adjacent students in a group of two must be an odd number.

        Example:
        >>> corridor = "....S.S...S..."
        >>> numberOfWays(corridor)
        12
