class Solution:
    def minSteps(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        """
        Calculates the minimum number of steps required to make two strings s and t
        anagrams, where a step is defined as removing or adding a character.

        Parameters:
        - s (str): The first input string.
        - t (str): The second input string.

        Returns:
        - int: The minimum number of steps to make s and t anagrams.

        Example:
        minSteps("abc", "bca") should return 0, as "abc" and "bca" are already anagrams.

        Note:
        - An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another.
        - The input strings can have different lengths.

        Complexity:
        - Time: O(N), where N is the length of the longer of the two input strings.
        - Space: O(C), where C is the number of unique characters in the input strings.
