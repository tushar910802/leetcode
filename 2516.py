        Given a string `s` containing only characters 'a', 'b', and 'c', 
        this function determines the minimum time (length of the substring) 
        required to take at least `k` occurrences of each character ('a', 'b', and 'c') 
        from both the left and right of the string. 
        If it's not possible, the function returns -1.

        Parameters:
        s (str): The input string consisting of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
        k (int): The minimum required occurrences of each character.
