class Solution:
    def countNicePairs(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Counts the number of 'nice pairs' in the given list of integers.

        A 'nice pair' is defined as a pair of integers (a, b) where:
        a and b are from the input list 'nums'
        The difference between 'a' and the reverse of 'a' is equal to the difference between 'b' and the reverse of 'b'.

        Args:
        - nums (List[int]): A list of integers.

        Returns:
        - int: The count of 'nice pairs' modulo 1000000007.
